hey friends i like to solve coding problems in codechef and other coding platforms 
i solve a few coding problem daily in codechef and it is consuming a considerable amount of time to upload the solutions in github 
i usually solve problems in codechef and paste it in my notepad


formate(
//problem name 
code
//problem2 name 
code for problem2
//and so on...
)


and finally after solving a bunch of them i upload it in github 
is there a way to automate this process using python or with the help of some other tools.


once done with the final answer i will update it.
